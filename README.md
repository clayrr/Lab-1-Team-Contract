## 2) Individual responsibilities

Each member is responsible for completing tasks & assignments before the assigned deadline. If an emergency occurs that impedes the completion of said deadline, or the member is otherwise unable to complete the task, they must communicate with the other team members well before the deadline.

Members must be reachable. They are expected to respond to or otherwise acknowledge communications (**text, snap, Github Issues**, etc.) within 24hrs.

Each member should respect teammates and provide help when needed. Nobody should make fun of anyone for not knowing something. 


## 3) Roles

## 4) Plan for Note-Keeping

Everyone is expected to take their own notes, but if someone is absent or has another valid reason, members will share notes for that time.  

## 5) Accountability

Individuals will be held accountable through the team contract. If a teammate is not reachable or not putting in the work then we will talk to them or even involve Ms. Feng. 

## 6) Conflict

We will always discuss issues and whatever is going on maturely, though we will try to avoid conflict by keeping in constant communication. If we need extra help dealing with conflict, we can involve Ms. Feng. 

## 7) Code of Ethics

- Act respectfully
- Donâ€™t be mean
- Be chill/flexible
- Help each other and work together
- Stay in constant communication
