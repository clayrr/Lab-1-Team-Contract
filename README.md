ms fengs feedback:
Feedback: 

- [x] If you are gonna rick roll, use it as a surprise. Hide the link somewhere. It can't be the first thing I see!! 
- [x] Where are ethans frees? Where are Claire's skills? I know both those things exist! 
- [x] Since you do not share any frees in which the whole group is free, what is your strategy to sync up? 
- [x] Please find some time before class Wednesday to discuss as a group and make changes to incorporate the feedback.
